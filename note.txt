First i have to parse the file
also if the file was empty u have to give a default file
parse mime type too

*THIS IS MY CONFIG FILE KEYWORDS:
-outside of the server only comments and newline are allowed.
-#ll = comments.
-listen = listen in a port only use in the server.
-status_page = use "status_page 404 path", only use in server and it sets by default if not specify.
-allow_methods = specify the method u want, use in the server and the location.
-server_name = here sepecify the server name, only use in server.
-root = use "root path", use in server and location.
-index = use "index name name...", use in server and location.
-autoindex = use "off/on", it's set to off by default, use in server and location.
-client_max_body_size = use "number", size of body response, use in server and location.
-mime_types = give mime file, use in server and location, if not specify it sets by default.
-location path {} = sets the location and parameter.
-return = use "return 'id status' "path" " redirect to a path, use only in location.
-cgi_info = use "cgi_info '.extention' 'path'" specify the binary code that gonna run the file, use in location and server.
-upload = use "upload on/off", use only in location, it sets to off by default if not specify.

Grammer BNF:


TODO in parsing:
-just skip all comments
-add flag -t

-----------
-Now i need to parse the data of server and mime tyes.
-Location will take all the behavior of the server and then start overriden the data in location i wll make a copy constructer.
-Now i have to fix if the server have data it will delete the obj data and overide it.
-Maybe Default_serv will inherit from parssing so i can parse the server data
-Also check the path of Location if they are repeated and also for the other element of the server
